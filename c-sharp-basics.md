### Dotnet

. NET is an open-source platform for building desktop, web, and mobile applications that can run natively on any operating system. Dotnet SDK contains necessary runtimes compiling and executing dotnet applications. .NET has evolved over the years into different implementations, .NET Core is cross platform and recommended.

When discussing .NET support policies, it's important to note the duration of support for both LTS and STS releases:

-   **LTS (Long-Term Support)**: LTS releases are maintained for at least **three years** after the initial release. They are intended for users who prioritize stability and longer-term support over having the latest features. LTS releases are a good choice for applications that will be in production for a long time and that don't need the latest features or improvements.

-   **STS (Short-Term Support)**: STS releases are maintained for about **15 months** after the initial release. They are intended for users who want to use the latest features and improvements as soon as they are available. STS releases are a good choice for applications that can be updated to newer versions of .NET more frequently, or for applications that need the latest features or improvements.

### Solution and project

-   In .NET, the terms "solution" and "project" are used to organize and manage your code.
-   Project: A project (.csproj for C#, .fsproj for F#, .vbproj for VB.NET) contains all the files that are compiled into an assembly (DLL or Executable binary). A project also contains a list of references to other projects or assemblies that it depends on. Projects can be compiled separately.
-   Solution: A solution (.sln) is a structure for organizing projects under one centralized file. It can contain one or more projects like class libraries, console apps, web apps. When a solutution is compiled, all the projects compiles inside it.

### Dotnet CLI

-   `<...>` is for placeholder purpose, actual input will be any valid string without `<` `>`

```bash
# create new solution
dotnet new sln --output <output_location> --name <solution_name>

# types of project
dotnet new list

# create a project
dotnet new <type> --output <output_location> --name <project_name>

# add project to solution
dotnet sln add <project_path>.csproj

# add a nuget pkg
dotnet add package Dumpify
```

### `Main` method and Top-level statement

```cs
class Program
{
   public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Display the number of command line arguments.
        Console.WriteLine(args.Length);
    }
}
```

-   The Main method is the entry point of an executable C# program; it is where the program control starts and ends.

-   Starting in C# 9, you don't have to explicitly include a Main method in a console application project. Instead, you can use the top-level statements feature to minimize the code you have to write. In this case, the compiler generates a class and Main method entry point for the application.
-   An application must have only one entry point. A project can have only one file with top-level statements.
-   A file with top-level statements can also contain namespaces and type definitions, but they must come after the top-level statements.

### Naming convention

| Object Name        | Notation    | Length | Plural | Abbreviation |
| :----------------- | :---------- | -----: | :----- | :----------- |

| Enum type name     | PascalCase  |    128 | Yes    | No           |

### Namespace

-   The namespace keyword is used to declare a scope that contains a set of related objects.
-   The name of the `namespace` must be a valid C# identifier name.
-   The compiler adds a default namespace. This unnamed namespace, sometimes referred to as the global namespace, is present in every file. It contains declarations not included in a declared namespace. Any identifier in the global namespace is available for use in a named namespace.
-   File scoped namespace declarations enable you to declare that all types in a file are in a single namespace. File scoped namespaces can't include additional namespace declarations. You cannot declare a nested namespace or a second file-scoped namespace.

```cs
// file scoped namespace
namespace FileScoped;
class BlaBla {}

// block scoped namespace
namespace BlockScoped
{
	class BlaBla {}
}
```

### Class

-   `readonly` means it can only be set either from constructor or by initialization.
-   `const` means it can only be set by initialization.
-   `static` members has to be accessed by class name.

```cs
public class User
{
    // const field
    public const string Country = "BD";

    // static readonly field
    public static readonly string Star = "Sun";

    // readonly field
    public readonly string Planet = "Earth";

    // field
    private bool _isEmailConfirmed;

    // field initializer
    public required string FullName { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    // auto property
    public required string UserName { get; set; }
    public string? Email { get; set; }

    // property with backing field
    public bool IsEmailConfirmed
    {
        get => _isEmailConfirmed;
        set
        {
            if (value && Email is not null) _isEmailConfirmed = value;
            else if (value is false && Email is null) _isEmailConfirmed = value;
        }
    }
}
```

### Record

-   A record is a speacial type of class.
-   Useful for carrying read-only data like DTO. By default, Record types are immutable.
-   Two instances of record can be compared by `=` operator which is not possible with class.

```cs
public record AppUserLoginRequest(string UserName, string Password);
```

### Struct

-   `struct` is value type, that means memory is allocated in stack rather than heap.
-   A `struct` type can't inherit from other class or structure type and it can't be the base of a class. However, a structure type can implement interfaces.
-   Unlike `class`, a `struct` always has a Parameterless default constructor which is not overridden when paramterized constructor is added.
```cs
public struct Person
{
    public required string FullName { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

`struct` type declarations with field initializers must include an explicitly declared constructor.

```cs
public struct Person
{
    public Person()
    {
    }

    public required string FullName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int Age { get; set; } = 13;
}
```

### Enum

-   The default underlying numeric type of Enum is `int`, it can be changed as well.

```cs
public enum BlogStatus : byte
{
    Published = 1,
    Draft
}
```

### Interface

-   An interface defines a contract between user-defined types.
-   By convention, an interface name starts with the letter I.
-   All the members of an interface are public by default.
-   An interface contains members including methods, properties, indexers, and events.
-   A user-defined type that implements an interface must provide implementations for the members of the interface.
-   A user-defined type can implement multiple interfaces.
-   An interface can extend one or more interfaces.

```cs
interface IMyInterface
{
    void MyMethod();
}
```

### Anonymous Type

-   Anonymous types allow you to encapsulate a set of read-only properties into a single object without having to define a class first.

-   Behind the scenes, the compiler will generate the type name for the anonymous type.

```cs
var products = new[]
{
    new { Name = "Phone X", Price = 999.99 },
    new { Name = "Computer Y", Price = 1999.99 },
    new { Name = "Tablet Z", Price = 2999.99 }
};
```

### Extension method

-   Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.
-   Extension methods are static methods, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.
-   The main advantage of the extension method is to add new methods in the existing class without using inheritance.
-   you need `this` keyword and the target type which will be extended as the first parameter.

```cs
public static class MyExtensions
{
    public static bool IsConstantCase(this string text)
    {
        return text.All(c => char.IsUpper(c));
    }
}
```

### Type inference with `var` keyword

-   Use the `var` keyword for a variable with initialization from which the compiler can infer a type.
-   The motto is: type should be only visible in one side of variable declaration, either right or left. `var` is used when type is evident in the left side.

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

IList<int> digitsList = [10, 20, 30, 35, 55, 66];
var digitsListWithVar = new List<int> { 10, 20, 30, 35, 55, 66 };

```

### Object initializer

```cs
var user = new User
{
    FullName = "John Doe",
    UserName = "john-doe"
};

User user = new()
{
    FullName = "John Doe",
    UserName = "john-doe"
};
```

### Generics

-   Generics allow you to write code that works with more than one type.
-   Generic constraints specify constraints on the type used as arguments for type parameters in generic type. Use the `where` keyword to specify generic constraints.

```cs
public static TNumber AddTwoNumbers<TNumber>(TNumber a, TNumber b)
    where TNumber : INumber<TNumber>
{
    return a + b;
}
```

### Type casting

-   An object reference can be implicitly upcast to a base class reference. An upcast always succeeds.
-   An object reference can also be explicitly downcast to a subclass reference. A downcast succeeds only if the object is compatible typed. Syntax: `(T)E`
-   Use the `as` operator to perform a downcast that evaluates to null rather than throwing an exception.

```cs
var employee = new Employee
{
    Name = "John Doe",
    JobTitle = "C# Developer"
};

Person person = employee; // upcast
Employee employee2 = (Employee)person; // downcast
Employee? employee3 = person as Employee; // downcast


class Person
{
    public required string Name { get; set; }
}

class Employee : Person
{
    public required string JobTitle { get; set; }
}
```

### Important interfaces

`IEnumerable<T>`: When we need a read-only operation, we can use `IEnumerable<T>`. It is for looping through the collection in the forward direction only. It supports deferred execution and filtering.

`ICollection<T>`: `ICollection<T>` extends `IEnumerable<T>`. ICollection allows to add or remove elements in the collection which is not possible with IEnumerable. But we still can’t perform any index-related operations. But we still can’t perform any index-related operations.

`IList<T>`: `IList<T>` extends `ICollection<T>`. It allows index-related operations like `Insert()`, `RemoveAt()` etc.

`IQueryable<T>`: Use for working with Database, processing will be done in the DB side. Fetched data can be translated to ICollection or IList easily.

```cs
IEnumerable<int> digitsEnumerable = [10, 20, 30, 35, 55, 66];
ICollection<int> digitsCollection = [10, 20, 30, 35, 55, 66];
IList<int> digitsList = [10, 20, 30, 35, 55, 66];
```

### Lambda

-   A lambda expression can reference any variables including local variables, parameters, and members that are accessible from the location where you define the lambda expression.
-   The variables referenced by a lambda expression are known as captured variables. When a lambda expression has captured variables, it is called a closure.
-   When a lambda expression captures variables, the C# compiler needs to create a private class and instantiate it to store a reference to the captured variables. This incurs a small performance. you can use a static keyword to ensure that the lambda expression doesn’t capture any variables.

```cs
// expression lambda
var sum1 = (int a, int b) => a + b;

// statement lambda
var sum2 = (int a, int b) =>
{
    var sum = a + b;
    return sum;
};

// avoid capturing outer variable
int factor = 2;
var square = static (int x) => x * factor; // ERROR

```

### Linq

```cs
// 1. Data source
IList<int> digitsEnumerable = [10, 20, 30, 35, 55, 66];

// 2. Query creation
var numberQuerySyntax =
    from number in digitsEnumerable
    where number % 2 == 0
    select number;

var numberMethodSyntax = digitsEnumerable.Where(x => x % 2 == 0);

// 3. Query execution
foreach (var number in numberQuerySyntax)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}

Console.WriteLine("############");

foreach (var number in numberMethodSyntax)
{
    Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

### Null safety

-   The null keyword is a literal that represents a null reference, one that does not refer to any object. null is the default value of reference-type variables. Ordinary value types cannot be null, except for nullable value types.
-   If you're a .NET developer, chances are you've encountered the `System.NullReferenceException`. This occurs at run time when a null is de referenced; that is, when a variable is evaluated at runtime, but the variable refers to null.
-   C# has a feature named `Nullability` which helps to mitigate `System.NullReferenceException` exception. For that, you must add this line in your `csproj` file: `<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`. Keep in mind, `Nullability` is a way to get compile-time warnings about possible null references, but it won't prevent null reference exceptions at runtime. You just express your intention here. Like `string?` means I wish to assign null here, while `string` means I won't assign `null` here. This is just your intension, because `string` is reference type, it is always nullable, not adding `?` won't make it non-nullable. But for value types, like `bool?`, this will change the behaviour of `bool`, now you can assign `null` along with `true` and `false`
-   Use null-conditional operator for safe member access, `?.`, and safe element access, `?[]` like `student?.Courses?[2]`
-   The null-coalescing operator `??` returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't null; otherwise, it evaluates the right-hand operand and returns its result.
-   The null-coalescing assignment operator `??=` assigns the value of its right-hand operand to its left-hand operand only if the left-hand operand evaluates to null.

### Asynchronous programming

-   The core of async programming is the `Task` and `Task<T>` objects, which model asynchronous operations. They are supported by the async and await keywords.
-   For I/O-bound code, you await an operation that returns a `Task` or `Task<T>` inside of an `async` method.
-   For CPU-bound code, you await an operation that is started on a background thread with the `Task.Run` method.

I/O-bound example:

```cs
    public class Todo
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public int UserId { get; set; }
        public string? Title { get; set; }
        public bool Completed { get; set; }
    }

    public async Task<IList<Todo>> LoadTodoData()
    {
        using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
        var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");
        var todos = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync<List<Todo>>();
        return todos ?? [];
    }
```

CPU-bound example:

```cs
public class TaskRunner
{
    public void RunTask()
    {
        Task.Run(() => new LongRunningTaskService().PerformTask());
        Console.WriteLine("TaskRunner continues to execute...");
    }
}

public class LongRunningTaskService
{
    public void PerformTask()
    {
        // Simulate long running task
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
        Console.WriteLine("Long running task has completed.");
    }
}
```

### Delegate (`Func`, `Action`, `Predicate`)

-   Delegate can be described as type-safe function pointer.
-   Since delegates hold references to methods, you can pass methods as arguments to other methods via the delegates. Therefore, delegates are ideal for defining callback methods.
-   Delegates are immutable. It means that a delegate cannot be changed once it is created.
-   Delegate can be declared outside of class.

```cs
public delegate void Callback(string message);

// Create a method for a delegate.
public static void DelegateMethod(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message);
}

// Instantiate the delegate.
Callback handler = DelegateMethod;

// Call the delegate.
handler("Hello World");
```

-   `Func`, `Action`, and `Predicate` are all built-in delegate types in C#. They are generic and can be used with any type.

-   `Func` and `Action` can take 0-16 argument.
-   The last parameter in `Func` is reserved for return type because `Func` always return something.
-   `Action` is similar to Func except `Action` doesn’t have any return type.
-   `Predicate` takes one parameter and must return bool.

```cs
public class MyClass
{
    public void UseFunc(Func<int, string> converter)
    {
        const int number = 123;
        var result = converter(number);
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }

    public void UseAction(Action<string> messagePrinter)
    {
        const string message = "Hello, World!";
        messagePrinter(message);
    }

    public void UsePredicate(Predicate<int> checker)
    {
        const int number = 4;
        var isEven = checker(number);
        Console.WriteLine(isEven);
    }
}



public class UseBuiltInDelegate
{
    public void ExecuteMethods()
    {
        var myClass = new MyClass();

        string MyFunc(int number) => number.ToString();
        myClass.UseFunc(MyFunc);

        void MyAction(string message) => Console.WriteLine(message);
        myClass.UseAction(MyAction);

        bool MyPredicate(int number) => number % 2 == 0;
        myClass.UsePredicate(MyPredicate);
    }
}
```
