In backend systems we have services like database like Redis, Postgres, etc. When several requests comes in the backend server, there may be some unexpected delay, For example, usually ready has latency of a few milliseconds. But in some cases, this latency can increase drastically. We cannot figure out which service is causing the latency by inspecting logs. This is why we need tracing tools like open telemetry.
